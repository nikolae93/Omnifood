# Omnifood
Single page web app for a fictional Omnifood company

This app was part of the HTML5 and CSS3 course on Udemy taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.
The original app contains a section that utilizes Google Maps but since then Google changed its policy
so I deleted section with the map and added a basic back end (NodeJS).
